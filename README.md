# Central Park Explorer Backend

This Rails App uses a custom seedfile and PostGIS database with custom Shapefiles to populate data about the various areas of Central Park. It takes in the current location from a user's device and yields back their area within the park along with various details.

Additionally, the app takes in user reviews and info to provide personalized recommendations for Central Park exploring.

The front-end repo is available [here](https://github.com/NickyEXE/Central-Park-Explorer).
